"""
This code is to experiment with the keypoint_corrector.

1. Does the keypoint corrector really correct abberations in the detected keypoints. If so, by how much?
2. What is the best way to optimize the keypoint correction? What algorithm works and what doesn't?
3. What is the best cost function to use to achieve our end-objective: chamfer loss, soft chamfer loss, a combination
    of chamfer and keypoint loss?
