"""
This code is to experiment with the keypoint_corrector.

1. Does the keypoint corrector really correct abberations in the detected keypoints. If so, by how much?
2. What is the best way to optimize the keypoint correction? What algorithm works and what doesn't?
3. What is the best cost function to use to achieve our end-objective: chamfer loss, soft chamfer loss, a combination
    of chamfer and keypoint loss?

# Get an input point cloud model with sufficient number of keypoints



# Generate inputs by transforming and occluding the input point cloud. Add abberations to the keypoints.



# See if the PACE + Keyoint Correction Module is able to detect corrections.
